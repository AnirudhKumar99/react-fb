IMPLEMENTING AUTHORIZATION
==========================

FIRST STEP
==========

A request is sent to profile update
    This is what the url will look like
        http://localhost:8080/profile/userid261951336956236


when there is userid in the incoming request(url)
    based on that userid
        out backen will make a quiery to database and load that user information(name, email etc)
            then we will add that information to the request object
                like so: req.profile=userInformation


SECOND STEP
===========
add a property called auth is requireSignin()
    so that we know the user is authenticated

THIRD STEP
==========
create hasAuthorization()
    to make sure the req object has
        req.profile && req.auth &&req.profile._id==req.auth._id
